Rotate the middle brick counter-clockwise.
Rotate the outer bricks clockwise.

Create the player using images (1-16) for Idle, (17-32) for Walk , 
and (193-205) for Fly from moustacheMan.png.
Allow the player to idle and walk both to the left and right.
When the player is walking, the player can fly by selecting the space bar.
The player can continue to fly in the direction it is moving by selecting 
the space bar while flying.  The player should go back to idle when it hits
the ground.

Use item_tube.png for the cannon and cannonball.png for the cannonballs.
Cannonballs should be instantiated and randomly shot every 2.0 to 5.0 seconds
out of the cannon.  It should appear that the cannonballs are shot out of the
cannon.  Cannonballs should be shot with a force to the right and use Unity physics 
to bounce off the stationary bricks.  Cannonballs are allowed to go through
the rotating bricks.  Cannonballs should be destroyed after 3 seconds.

If the player collides with the rotating bricks or a cannonball, 
the player should go back to the starting point.

A win box should be added on the left side.  The goal is for the player to 
walk/fly to get to the win box.  When the player gets to the win box, the 
cannon should be removed.  It should be fairly easy for the player to get
to the win box.

When you build your executable, select Player Settings...  and find
Resolution and Presentation in lower right and choose Windowed and
Resizable Window.
